### Sketch 2

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern

 This is a 2-part Sketch



Part 1:

 Using 1 form/shape and create 6 drastically different grid-like patterns with it. Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. Use a keyPress to switch between different patterns. As a result, all of your patterns should appear in one sketch

 - use active mode
 - use variables
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique, and to have variety


Part 2:

Using one shape or collection of marks, create a pattern with multiple versions of your shape arranged in a different format. 

Once you have that pattern created, how can you use it as a drawing tool/instrument? Can you have multiple versions appear on the page, around an origination point, with one input? Think how the multiple bristles on a brush lay ink. Can you drop 3 or 4 visable versions of your pattern at once?

Can you send it values to animate it across space based upon an input? Can you create a loop, which creates your pattern? Can you then trigger that loop upon input? Can this sequence of events take in data, to make it slightly different over time? 

Can you then create different brushes, each with a unique form/pattern. How many iterations of your pattern occur with one click or mouse movement? How does the size change? How does the space between the marks change? Can you make a spray can pattern? Does something happen to the mark once it's on the page? Does it bleed, spread, or blend with other colors on the page?

 - How could you incorporate random and/or interactivity to add variety + change? How could this be controlled over time?

 - Use your matrix transformations and for-loops
