### Final Project Scheduler/Task Manager

 When ever working on a large project, especially one that involved multiple components, it's intergral to map out that project in order to manager your time and tasks appropriately. Doing so allows you to  focus on the task at hand, while still retaining a clear overall picture.


Begin working on your [final project](Final_Project.md) by doing the following: 

#### First Step:
* Craft a 3 sentence project statement (think elevator pitch) that tells a Grandmother what your project is about and what it does. Add other information as needed, but keep it brief - specific but at a high level. 

#### Second Step:
* List out _specific goals_ for the project. Bullet point each. Possible examples: Develop 5 puzzles, successful use of The New York Times API, utilizing vectors to create movement, creating 5 different classes each with several methods that gets utilized through the project, creating 4 different types of interaction, creating a state machine to manage graphics/interaction, thoughtful intergration of sound, intergration of sensors, etc. 


#### Third Step:
* Organize your resources. List your inspirations, resources, references that you are going to pull from. These should be diverse and beyond the supplied textbooks.

 	    
#### Fourth Step:
* Then, break _each_ of your goals down into smaller tasks. Stage these smaller tasks as goals for each of the 3 weeks. 

Break these tasks down into decipherable tasks, tasks that are actionable. From this point, write pseudo code and translate that into code. 


#### Fifth Step:
* Review the Final Briefing for the milestone requirements for your working prototype, beta version and alph version. Factor in what needs to be acheived by these dates with reference to your project and fill in your project plan accordingly.
