###### Due 12/7/18

Attend the exhibition *Programmed: Rules, Codes, and Choreographies in Art, 1965–2018* at The Whitney Museum of Art. Take a selfie with you and a work in the show. Study the piece and how it functions. Pseudo code 5-15 seconds of the piece, when it is actively and dynamically changing. Document this portion of the piece also running (ideally in video, otherwise through a succession of multiple images). The pseudo code should be specific and as explicit as possible. Do not be generalized nor operating at a summary level.

Use a text editor. 

Title a folder with your name_extraCredit. Place the text file, as well as another folder of documentation into this folder. Zip and share the folder with me via slack DM (or a link sent through slack dm). Due December 7th.
