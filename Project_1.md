## Project 1 - Drawing Machine

**Due November 1th --> In class critiques**

**20% of your final grade**

Weekly pushes and changes are expected


Make a drawing machine. This should be experimental, crafted and unknown. It should not be totally random and it should not be completely determined. Push color, shape, size, timing and frequency.

Your machine should:

- be visually evident, changing over time
- be interactive in some fashion with the mouse
- have the ability to clear or erase the screen
- use randomness in some interesting, yet crafted, way


If you wish to add sound, it cannot be a sound track. The sound must relate the visuals, whats happening with visuals and interaction in some way. It can't be thrown in over the top of the project. It must be interegrated and controlled (on-goingly) with code.

You may not use images.  Only drawing functions, meaning mostly stuff found in the ‘graphics’ section.

Use only the drawing functions - stuff found in the Shape, Color, Events and Math sections. Make sure to read Learning Processing Chapters 13 + 14, as well as the Generative Design Text.

Create custom functions that are triggered on some event, and make those functions vary. The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be with only line, shapes, color and movement?


### Ingredients: <br>

• Graphics (shape, color, line, placement, custom shapes) <br>
• Control Structures (if, for, while) <br>
• Movement <br>
• Interaction (mouse, keyboard)<br>
• Custom functions with passing parameters<br>
• Arrays<br>
• Math <br>
• Random (crafted)<br>
• OOP <br>

### Must haves: 
<br>
	• heavy use of variables<br>
	• custom functions passing variables as parameter <br>
	• loops <br>
	• control structures <br>
	• math or random <br>
	• some use of interaction or change over time <br>
	• movement, change, variety <br>
	• arrays <br>
	• conditionals <br>
	• custom OOP usage with methods and parameters <br>
