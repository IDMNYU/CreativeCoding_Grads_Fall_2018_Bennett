### Final Deliverables

# Self Assessment

Using Word or another text editor, reflect on the following: 

• Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming, and how does this reflect on the final quality of your end result. 

• Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.

• Compare and contrast OOP versus Procedural Programming.


• Specifically considering your final project: What programming concepts solidified in your final project? What did you learn with reference to programming? Did you have a break through?

• Specifically considering your final project: Were you able to resolve your own bugs? What tricks did you learn in the process to help? Did you do any debugging? 

• How do you think you'll move forward with programming? will you keep doing it ? How does this relate to other classes you are either taking or wish to take? 



# Also do each of the following:

### Documentation of your final project:

• Take several screen shots of application running. If it's interactive take some photos and video of someone interacting with it.

• copy and pasted into Sublime and take a screen shots of code, that you are particularly proud of (not the entire project). The code needs to have comments associated with it.

• concept paragraph answering the following: What is your piece about? What's the concept? Is it interactive, responsive or time based?, name of piece

• Direct Message me on Slack  the above documents.


• Submit any missing exercises to get credit for them. Post them to github and DM me that they are up.

• Each repo is named after the assignment and with all of the work, code, documentation, support files, editions. Leave the other repository up there if you have multiple ones. Just name sure to make a new one if you currently have multiple repository for one assignment 

# All of the above must be submitted by Noon Monday - 12/17/18.
